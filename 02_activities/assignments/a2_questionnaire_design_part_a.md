# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part A)

## Requirements
Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.


### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.


# Your Changes

The number of your chosen topic: `#`

Describe the purpose of your survey:
```
This survey aims to identify the primary factors contributing to high turnover rates among entry- and lower-level positions at our tech company. The insights gathered will help understand employee satisfaction issues and inform targeted retention strategies to reduce turnover rates across departments.
```

Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:
```
Target Population: All current and former entry- and lower-level employees at the company, including those who left within the past 6 months.

Sampling Frame: Company HR database that includes contact information for both current entry-level employees and recently departed employees.

Sampling Units: Individual employees.

Sampling Strategy:  Randomly select employees from each department to ensure feedback is obtained from across the entire company. Select a larger number of employees from departments that have high turnover recently, as these areas likely have more insights into why people are leaving. For former employees: survey everyone who left in the past 6 months since this is a smaller group.
```

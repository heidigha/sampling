Sampling(e.g.No random selection procedures) ; 2. Coverage (e.g. Panel composition may not match population)  3. Processing Error; 4. Technical Issues |1. he measured call source levels may underestimate the true call intensities used by G. soricina in the wild.  2. the captive colony of G. soricina had been fed an exclusively plant-based diet for generations, making them "naive" to insects as prey influencing their behavioral responses compared to wild bats with more experience hunting insects.    3. Generalization to wild populations   4. Incomplete dietary information |
| Limitations, known biases                             |   1. First time offering Internet option in 2018 (Not appropriate to compare 2018 results with previous iterations due to mode changes) 2. The exclusion of residents in Yukon, NW Territories & Nunavut; households without telephone; Full-time residents of institutions 3.Overall response rate was 41.9% (lower than previous years) Biases: Non-respondents more likely to be: Males and yonger people. |1. Online Panel Limitations 2. Geographic Coverage (Territories not included ) 3. Return Rate Issues (< 50%) 4. Online-only survey 5. Limited campaign period coverage 6. Selection Bias (Online panel recruitment) 7. Excludsion of non-internet users 8.Panel Bias |Key limitations:around the generalizability of findings; Known biases to the experimental conditions and analytical choices made by the researchers.

# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part B)

## Requirements
1. Comment on the quality of your sample. Do you expect it to be representative of your target population? Why or why not?

 The sample should be reasonably representative of the target population, though there are some potential limitations to consider:

Strengths:
- access to a complete HR database for both current and former employees, minimizing coverage error
- the sampling strategy prioritizes departments with highest turnover, helping focus on the most affected areas

Limitations:
- Response bias may occur as former employees might be less likely to respond, potentially underrepresenting their perspectives
- Focusing on high-turnover departments, while strategic, might miss important insights from more stable departments
- Recent departures (within 6 months) may not capture longer-term turnover patterns or reasons for leaving from earlier periods
    ```

2. Given the class content (error, survey quality, ethics) covered since Part A of the assignment, do you wish to make any changes to your original survey? If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. Provide a link here for submission.

   Yes, I would make several changes to improve the survey quality and address potential ethical concerns:

1. Add an informed consent section explaining:
   - Purpose of data collection
   - How data will be used
   - Confidentiality measures
   - Right to skip questions or withdraw

2. Add demographic questions while ensuring anonymity:
   - Department (broad categories to maintain confidentiality)
   - Job level (entry vs. lower-level)
   - Length of time in current role

3. Revise Question 3 to:
   - Allow multiple selections since turnover often has multiple causes
   - Add "Prefer not to disclose" option


4. Add open-ended questions:
   - "What initially attracted you to work at this company?"
   - "What aspects of your job do/did you find most rewarding?"

These changes aim to:
- Improve ethical considerations through informed consent
- Reduce various forms of response bias
- Better protect respondent privacy
- Provide more context for understanding turnover patterns..
    ```

3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?

While an observational study could provide some insights into turnover, it would not fully satisfy the survey's purpose for several reasons:

1. Many key factors are not directly observable:
   - Employee satisfaction levels
   - Personal career goals and aspirations
   - Reasons for leaving
   - Suggested improvements

2. Observable metrics like performance reviews, promotion rates, or attendance could indicate dissatisfaction but wouldn't reveal underlying causes

3.  Exit interviews, while observational, often suffer from social desirability bias as departing employees may want to maintain professional relationships

Therefore, while supplemental observational data (like turnover rates, promotion patterns, salary comparisons) could provide insight , a survey is necessary to directly capture employees' perspectives, experiences, and suggestions for improvement.

## Why am I doing this assignment?

This assignment supports learning outcomes 1, 2, 3, and 4:
	1.	Develop ability to implement simple probability samples.
	2.	Understand more complicated sampling procedures and the tradeoffs involved.
	3.	Identify and understand sources of error or inaccuracies in data as a result of sampling strategies.
	4.	Develop intuition around survey quality.

## Rubric

-	All required components are present and complete **Complete / Incomplete**
-	Assessment of representativeness is justified based on class content **Complete / Incomplete**
-	Changes to original survey are justified based on class content and best practices for sampling **Complete / Incomplete**
